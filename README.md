# iris_ml_model
Using the very famous Iris data set, I built a machine learning model that predicts with over 90% accuracy what kind of iris flower is being sampled (small data set) and in the overall Iris data set. Libraries used include sci-kit learn and joblib. Algorithm used: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).
